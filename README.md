# Tic Tac Toe in C++ using OOP principles

- Classes for the game board, players
- To validate each move, there is a function that checks if the selected square is valid.
- To determine if a player has won, a function that checks all possible winning combinations is used.
- I use error handling for potential run-time errors, such as invalid input, or out-of-bounds moves.
- The game allows players to play again or quit.
- The game progress is stored in a text file.
